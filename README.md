## 1. Guessing game

- The guessing game that we are going to implement in python has simple rules.
- First, the program generates a random number between 1 and 99.
- Then, it asks the user to guess the number.
- If the user enters a number less than the number generated by the system, the system tells the user that the guess is low. It then asks the user to guess the number again.
- If the number entered by the user is greater than the system-generated number, the system tells the user that guessed number is larger. It then asks the user to guess the number again.
- If the user guesses the number correctly, the system informs to the user and the game ends.





## 2. printing receipts after shopping

- Create a small shop with some products and prices where a buyer can view the list of a vailable products and their prices.
- when program runs, it should prompt buyer to create account using password and email and store this in an excel sheet.
- Then ask user for login if he has registered account else register
- The products shoulf be fetched from an excel sheet called products.
- Buyer can choose what to buy.
- Buyer can pay for what they have have bought
- Then print a reciept for the buyer.
Simple receipt example

This receipt should printed on terminal, dont bother about pdf printing for now

NB. This simulates the real world ecommerce situation, consider all possible human errors and catch them e.g buyer puts a price less that the total of items he has bought, buyer putting wrong. Use functions to break down your work into small codes. You can use modules and import them as well.
